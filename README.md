Memooie
==========
Use Rack::Session::Cookie to save only session-related info in the cookie and use memory to save all the other data.

Based on the original work from [Rack::Session::Cookie](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/session/cookie.rb)

## Notes
Only tested under [Padrino](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework) so just copy `memooie.rb` to `mainapp/lib`.
